                    <strong>Q1:</strong> What is your experience with JavaScript frameworks?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>I have extensive experience with several JavaScript frameworks including React, Angular, and Vue.js. In my previous projects, I have used React to build dynamic single-page applications, Angular for large-scale enterprise applications, and Vue.js for its simplicity and ease of integration.</p>

                    <strong>Q2:</strong> Can you explain the concept of closures in JavaScript?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures are commonly used for data privacy and to create function factories. For example, a closure can be used to create a counter function that has its own private variable.</p>

                    <strong>Q3:</strong> How do you handle version control in your projects?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>I use Git for version control in my projects. I follow a branching strategy, typically using feature branches for new features, bugfix branches for fixes, and a main branch for production-ready code. I also make use of pull requests to review code changes before merging them into the main branch.</p>

                    <strong>Q4:</strong> What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are table-based and are best for complex queries and transactions. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. They are more flexible and can handle unstructured data, making them ideal for big data and real-time web applications.</p>

                    <strong>Q5:</strong> Explain the concept of RESTful APIs.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>RESTful APIs are web services based on Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. They use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. They typically use JSON or XML for data interchange and follow standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.</p>
